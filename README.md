feat: writing the javascript code for pixel art maker project


the code is divided into 3 main elements choosing the grid size and color to
fill the grids then the method that use to draw the grids then changing the color
for the grids.

I link the input of grid size and color using elementid then using for loop
I create the grids and with toggle and if condition I fill color and unfill it.
